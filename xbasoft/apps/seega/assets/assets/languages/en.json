    "boardDescr": "Seega is played on a board of 5 squares by 5, the central square of which is marked with a pattern. The board starts empty, and each player starts with 12 pieces of his own colour in hand.",
    "placementTitle": "Placement",
    "placementDescr": "Players take turns to place 2 pieces each anywhere on the board, except for the central square.",
    "movingTitle": "Moving",
    "movingDescr": "When all pieces are placed, the second player begins the movement phase. A piece may move one square in any horizontal or vertical direction. In this phase pieces may move onto the central square. If a player is unable to move, his opponent must take an extra turn and create an opening.",
    "capturingTitle": "Capturing",
    "capturingDescr": "If a player in his move traps an enemy piece between two of his own, the enemy is captured and removed from the board. Diagonal entrapment does not count here. After moving a piece to capture an enemy, the player may continue to move the same piece while it can make further captures. If, when moving a piece, two or three enemies become simultaneously trapped, then all these trapped enemies are captured and removed from the board.",
    "safetyTitle": "Safety",
    "safetyDescr": "It is permissible to move a piece between two enemies without its being harmed. One of the enemies must move away and back again to effect a capture. A piece on the central square is immune from capture, but may itself be used to capture enemy pieces.",
    "gameOverTitle": "Game over",
    "gameOverDescr": "The game is won by the player who has captured all his enemy's pieces."
